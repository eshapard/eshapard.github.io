        <h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h2>

<p>In deck settings, set the <em>New Interval</em> under the <em>Lapses</em> tab to make the new interval of forgotten cards a percentage of their previous interval. Ideally, play with this percentage until you have an 80-90% success rate on re-learned cards.</p>

<h2 id="ankis-default-behavior">Anki’s default behavior</h2>

<p>I’m pretty sure that by default, what happens with Anki is that when you forget a review card, it goes into the <em>relearning</em> cue, and after it exits, it enters the review queue again with an interval of 1 days.</p>

<p>In my opinion, this isn’t very efficient.</p>

<p>Imagine that you’ve been studying a card for 10 years. You’ve gotten that card right every time and its last interval was large; maybe 3 years. You haven’t seen this card in 3 years, and you get it again today.</p>

<p>This time, you can’t quite remember it.</p>

<p>By default, the card would then start over again with an interval of only 1 day. Sure, it’s ease factor is still really high, so those intervals grow, but chances are, after being reminded of the answer, you probably could have remembered it for another 3 years or so.</p>

<p>Starting over from stage 1 is a waste of time.</p>

<p>Luckily, there’s an easy way to make those initial intervals after a lapse longer.</p>

<h2 id="advanced-options">Advanced options</h2>

<p>Open up the deck options for a deck and go to the <em>Lapses</em> tab.</p>

<p>Here you’ll see an option to set the <em>New Interval</em> after a lapse to a percentage of interval it had before the lapse.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anki uses the term <em>lapse</em> for review cards that you forgot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By default, this is set to 0%. After a lapse, instead of getting an interval of 0 days, cards get the minimum interval set here. By default, that’s a 1-day minimum interval.</p>

<h2 id="whats-an-ideal-setting">What’s an ideal setting?</h2>

<p>I think the ideal setting for a <em>new interval</em> percentage is whatever gives you an 80 to 90% success rate on that next review. And my hunch is that that’s actually a pretty high percentage; maybe 75%.</p>

<p>My reasoning behind the 80 to 90% success rate is that I think that’s where the most rewarding experience is; the range where reviews are not too hard, but not so easy that you don’t feel a sense of accomplishment.</p>

<p>Anki doesn’t provide access to this statistic out-of-the-box. There’s no simple view that tells you the success rate you have on that first review after relearning a card. But it is possible to use an SQLite browser to search the reviews table in the database for this.</p>

<p>What you have to do is come up with a search that finds all <em>review</em> reviews where the previous review was a <em>relearning</em> review. I actually have an addon code that does this and then adjusts the <em>new interval</em> percentage up or down for me. Alas, it’s tied up with a bunch of other code in a big addon I cobbled together a little at a time. I’m working on separating that beast into smaller components, and I’ll try to post some code that does just this soon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the manual refers to only three queues (new, learning, and review), there are actually four queues in Anki: new, learning, review, and re-learning.</p>

  <p>The re-learning queue is for cards that you forgot (<em>lapsed</em> cards) and are learning again. This is very similar to the learning queue (cards that were previously new), but the learning and re-learning queues each have their own steps.</p>
