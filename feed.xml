        <title>Haircut Recurrence With Task Warrior</title>
        <description>
          
          To recur a task X days after the last time it was completed, use the task-relative-recur extension by JensErat. I call this ‘haircut’ recurrence because you need to get your hair cut when it’s had enough time to grow long; not on the first of each month. Here’s the problem...

        <title>What You Need To Know About 'Remind' But The Documentation Doesn't Tell You</title>
        <description>
          
          This is the paragraph that’s missing from the introduction of remind’s man page, and every article I’ve ever read about it. If there are timed reminders for later in the day, then remind will continue running in the background, sending timed reminders to the terminal at their appointed times. So...

        <title>The Case For Multiple Goals</title>
        <description>
          
          A useful flashcard application would allow users to set different goals for different cards, control the way cards are prioritized during review sessions, and code custom scheduling and prioritizing algorithms. Furthermore, it would be very useful to purposely design the application to allow for experimental data generation and collection if...

          Being able to use overlapping and nested cloze deletions is super useful in a flashcard application. It’s something that I felt was sorely missing from the flashcard applications that I’ve used. [These are overlapping] cloze deletions These are [overlapping cloze deletions] And these are [nested] cloze deletions And these [are...

          These are some ideas I have for creating a usable flashcard program. They are somewhat organized by topic, but not placed in any particular order. This is sort of a brain-dump for me. I wanted to get these idea out of my head and written down. Some of these ideas...

          If you want to tackle Spanish verb conjugation in an order that goes from most common uses to least common uses, and in an order that gradually builds your knowledge using the smallest increments possible, I think the curriculum below may be what you’re looking for.

        <title>A Separate Taskwarrior Configuration For Ideas</title>
        <description>
          
          Task warrior has a lot of filtering options, but it’s faster to keep your ideas (or someday/maybes as they call them in Getting Things Done) completely separate. That way, you can see only the tasks you’re actually working on without cluttering up your task list wit the ideas you have...

          I got a private message from someone who’s developing an online learning platform for an after-school program.
