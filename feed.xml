        <title>Compiling Gargoyle On Ubuntu 18.04 On An Old Netbook</title>
        <description>
          
          I decided to play the classic interactive fiction game Zork, which is available as a Hugo re-write. Unfortunately, the gargoyle-free package for Ubuntu doesn’t have the (non-free) Hugo interpreter. Straight-up Gargoyle from github does, but it was a bit of a pain to compile. PreReqs Compiling It’ll probably look like...

        <title>Useful Kindle Stats</title>
        <description>
          
          I use a script to export highlights and notes from my kindle’s My Clippings.txt file to an sqlite3 database. Kindle to Sqlite3 Having these clippings in a database allows me to get some interesting and potentially useful statistics. Highlight (Information) Density I created this measurement to show how densely packed...

        <title>Kindle to Sqlite3</title>
        <description>
          
          I use a little python script to grab clippings out of my (early model) kindle’s My Clippings.txt file and import them into an sqlite3 database. The clips and notes are in a consistant format, so it’s possible to parse the file with some regular expressions, and a little logic. I...

        <title>Saving A Game Transcript In Gargoyle</title>
        <description>
          
          Yeah, so this is sort of embarrassing. I play interactive fiction using Gargoyle every now and then, and I’ve been trying to figure out a way around Gargoyle’s obvious lack of any transcript-export feature. Turns out, you just have to type script into the parser. From then on, all the...

        <title>Using Evapotraspiration Rates To Calculate How Much To Water</title>
        <description>
          
          Evapotraspiration (ETo) rates are handy figures you can use to estimate how long to turn on your sprinklers or drip irrigation. Unfortunately, most guides I’ve see either assume you have a degree in agriculture (and don’t really need instruction), or are completely clueless (so they dumb things down too much)....

        <title>Missing Intro Screen For Gargoyle Interactive Fiction</title>
        <description>
          
          Gargoyle, the interactive fiction interpreter, doesn’t support showing the little introduction screen that glulxe does; the screen with cover art and a description of the game. So I wrote my own quick-and-dirty shell script to do just that. You can use it as sort of a wrapper to start gargoyle....

          To recur a task X days after the last time it was completed, use the task-relative-recur extension by JensErat. I call this ‘haircut’ recurrence because you need to get your hair cut when it’s had enough time to grow long; not on the first of each month. Here’s the problem...

          This is the paragraph that’s missing from the introduction of remind’s man page, and every article I’ve ever read about it.

        <title>The Case For Multiple Goals</title>

          A useful flashcard application would allow users to set different goals for different cards, control the way cards are prioritized during review sessions, and code custom scheduling and prioritizing algorithms. Furthermore, it would be very useful to purposely design the application to allow for experimental data generation and collection if...
