        <p>I studied Esperanto for a couple years and regret it. I don’t consider it a total loss, but I would have gotten more out of studying Spanish, Italian, or French.</p>

<p>There are many reasons I regret wasting my time studying Esperanto. Here’s one no one talks about much: Esperanto attracts Grammar-Nazi-Assholes; and (based on my experience) that seems to be the majority of the online “community”.</p>

<h3 id="heres-the-problem-with-that">Here’s the problem with that:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Esperanto has <strong>very few prescriptive grammar rules</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>Thus, there’s a lot of flexibility in how you can express things.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Grammar-Nazi-Assholes <strong>live</strong> to accuse you of breaking rules.
    <ul>
      <li>This is difficult to do with a flexible language.</li>
      <li>Adding more rules to the language would aid Grammar-Nazi-Assholes in fulfilling their primary desire.</li>
      <li>Thus, these people are highly motivated to <strong>create</strong> rules that don’t exist.
        <ul>
          <li>This leads them to accept that the tiny Esperanto “community” is sufficient to switch from the <strong>prescriptive rules</strong> of Zamenhof, to <strong>descriptive rules</strong> based on mere <em>conventions</em> and <em>tendencies</em> of the Esperanto “community”.
            <ul>
              <li>Newcommers to the language don’t understand that the <strong>descriptive</strong> bullshit is not a <strong>prescriptive rule</strong> and accept it unquestioningly; thus, the mis-information problem becomes worse.</li>
              <li>As these false <strong>descriptive</strong> rules become dogmatic, long-time “community” members themselves become less aware of the distinction between the actual <strong>prescriptive rules</strong> of the language, and the mere conventions of a handful of assholes.</li>
              <li>Really ambitious (and probably well-meaning) people create things like PAG and PMEG which are <strong>descriptive</strong>; codifying mere conventions as (now <em>prescriptive</em>) rules.
                <ul>
                  <li>Grammar-Nazi-Assholes eat this stuff up and use it to justify their nit-picking activities in online forums.</li>
                  <li>Now it seems to newcomers that the Assholes really do know what they’re talking about.</li>
                  <li>The Assholes gain more of the authority that they crave</li>
                  <li>For anyone who buys into the bullshit, the language becames less flexible, and more cluttered with unneccessary rules.</li>
                  <li>Anyone who can pull back the curtain on this situation and see that the Wizard is just a con-man, becomes increasingly disgusted and most likely abandons Esperanto.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Thus the ratio of dogmatic assholes to reasonable people grows.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="esperanto-was-meant-to-be-flexible">Esperanto was meant to be flexible</h2>

<p>Zamenhof, really only wrote one grammar book to explain Esperanto: the <a href="http://www.akademio-de-esperanto.org/fundamento/gramatiko_angla.html">Fundamento de Esperanto</a>. And in my opinion, it’s a really good one. You start out with with some bare-bones rules which were translated into various natural languages, and then you jump into graded lessons in Esperanto that slowly introduce both vocabulary and grammar. The result is that you learn about Esperanto <em>in</em> Esperanto… a bit like how <em>Lingua Litina</em> slowly builds an understanding of Latin through comprehensive input.</p>

<p>In my opinion, if you still want to learn Esperanto after reading this article, then the <em>Fundamento</em> and its exercises are by far the best place to start.</p>

<p>OK, I don’t want to get into this much, but I think if you work you way through the <em>Fundamento</em> <strong>including the excercises</strong> (<em>ekzercaro</em>) where Zamenhof walks you through the rules of Esperanto <em>in Esperanto</em>, it becomes clear the language is supposed to have the flexibility to accommodate the natural inclinations of native speakers of several European languages.</p>

<p>For example, there’s a part where he talks about the article <em>la</em> (= the) and he basically says that while the article is in the language for speakers of languages that use articles, if you’re Russian or something and your native language doesn’t use articles, then don’t sweat it. The articles are <em>optional</em>. If you get used to how they’re used, go ahead and use them. If not, feel free to leave them out since <em>everyone will understand what you’re saying anyway</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on internet forums such as Lernu, this tolerant, communication-oriented mentality of Zamenhof seems to have died with him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Likewise, Zamenhof acknowledges that the same verb in some languages uses prepositions, while others use declension or syntax to mark what is directly receiving the action. Zamenhof states clearly that if your natural instinct is to use a preposition, then use one; if your natural instinct is not to use one, then you can mark the direct object of the verb by adding an <em>n</em> to the end (aka the accusative case; syntax is therefore fairly flexible). Whichever method you choose doesn’t matter much; the language is set up to convey the <em>meaning</em> despite differing <em>preferences in sentence construction</em>.</p>

<p>Lastly, in what I assume is a blatant display of francophilia, Zamenhof includes as one of his 16 <em>general grammar rules</em> that you can just drop the ending vowel off of the article (<em>la</em>) or nouns if it <em>sounds better to you</em>. You <em>do</em> have to replace that vowel with an apostrophe in writing, but of course, if you do this in speech, you just drop it. It’s a very strange rule that I figure is only there to make the language appeal more to French speakers.</p>

<h2 id="prescriptive-vs-descriptive">Prescriptive vs Descriptive</h2>

<p>Most languages are created naturally. People just spontaneously start using language, and out of the chaos come rules; rules which native speakers are often not consciously aware of.</p>

<p>The book <em>Seeing Voices</em> (by Oliver Sacks) does a good job of describing spontaneous language generation among communities of deaf people. This is one of the few situations where we’ve been able to see this phenomenon take place.</p>

<p>Grammarians, linguists and the like, then try to identify these rules and write them down. In one or two of his works, <a href="http://sdkrashen.com">Stephen Krashen</a> gives a good description of just how many of these rules we’ve been able to discover. Long story short: we don’t know them all even for the most studied language (English).</p>

<p>This is <strong>descriptive</strong> grammar. We are simply <em>describing</em> how the language is being used. There’s really no sense of how the language <em>should</em> work, of what the rules <em>should</em> be; that’s the domain of <em>prescriptive</em> grammar.</p>

<p>The big natural languages have all been <em>standardized</em> in various places. In the USA, we teach kids <em>Standard American English</em> in school. That comes with a bunch of rules about how you <em>should</em> use the language. This is <strong>prescriptive</strong> language. For a natural language, prescriptive rules generally come from <em>descriptive</em> rules that align with how the language is used by well educated speakers and writers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grammar-Nazi-Assholes sometimes promote other <em>rules</em> such as, “you can’t spilt an infinitive”, that have other origins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With a <em>natural</em> language, <em>prescriptive</em> rules pretty much <em>have to</em> come from <em>descriptive</em> rules. Rules emerge as part of our natural language-forming instincts and we can only discover them <em>after</em> language has formed; The rules are not created before the language; they emerge as part of its natural development.</p>

<p>With a <em>constructed</em> language, the rules are created first. We start with <strong>prescriptive</strong> rules created intentionally by the creator(s). In the case of Esperanto, that would be Zamenhof.</p>

<p>The assholes over at lernu.net would have you believe that they are now the authority; that their <em>descriptive</em> rules based on Esperanto’s relatively insignificant history and speaker-base (compare it to any natural language) justify creating new <em>prescriptive</em> rules.</p>

<p>I call bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, and if you think these people only look at common usage conventions in the “community” and aren’t swayed by their own personal preferences and inclinations, you’re kidding yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-vivid-example">A vivid example</h2>

<p>A few years ago, <a href="https://lernu.net/en/forumo/temo/19485">someone posted to the lernu.net forum</a> asking about why an online translation did something that an online translation did.</p>

<p>Four posters came and went and while one of them did at least mention that online translators can make mistakes, <em>no one attempted to answer the question being asked; namely, “WHY?”</em>. This is an annoying problem with internet forums; you ask a question and get replies… that don’t answer your question.</p>

<p>So I took a shot at answering it, saying that the computer had to make some reasonable assumptions, and that what the poster had seen was probably caused by a reasonable, but wrong assumption. The details aren’t very important. What’s important, was that I said the computer made a bad assumption. I then gave a small example of the kind of sentence the computer might have thought it was looking at; one with a pronoun in the “accusative” case along with a couple of verbs (one being in the infinitive).</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s not really the accusative, that’s just what most esperantists call it when you put the <em>-n</em> ending on a word. I don’t remember Zamenhof ever using the word ‘accusative’, but I’ll use that word for convenience.</li>
</ul>

<p>The example sentence was <em>Mi volas malrapide vin iri</em> (I want to go [to] you slowly).</p>

<p>This set off a shit storm.</p>

<p>Now let’s simplify that sentence to <em>Mi iras vin</em> (I go [to] you). This simplified form gets at the heart of the issue: can you use the accusative (-n ending) to show direction towards a person?</p>

<p>Well let’s start of by saying that normally, I’d say <em>Mi iras al vi</em> (I go to you). Here, I’d use a preposition (<em>al</em> = to) instead of the accusative, as would most esperantists. But the fact that a sentence such as <em>Mi iras vin</em> is uncommon <strong>does not mean it is incorrect</strong>.</p>

<p>And yet, that’s exactly the argument that was first leveled against it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kirilo81: “… it is virtually absent so that this can be called erroneous.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brilliant. If no one’s ever said it before, it’s incorrect. We don’t even need to consult Zamenhof.</p>

<p>Then erinja (forum admin) steps in and informs us that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>erinja: “It is erroneous to use the accusative of direction with anything that is not a location. You could theoretically use it with a personal pronoun only if you consider a person to be a location.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No source for that proclamation, as erinja always considers herself to be the authority on all matters Esperanto. But notice how she still allows for it to be admissible… as long as you consider a person to be a location. Well, since they occupy an area in space, why not? We certainly use people as locations in English! (e.g. “Come to me!”). Of course Esperanto does this as well, which is why <em>Mi iras al vi</em> (I go to you) doesn’t ruffle any feathers. (Compare to ‘I go to thirsty’).</p>

<p>In trying to justify her statement, erinja says that <em>Mi iras laboron</em> wouldn’t make sense either. That translates to <em>I go to [the] work</em> (remember how the article is optional?). That makes a whole lot of sense to me. Wherever there’s work, that’s where I’ll go. I follow the work. I go to work!</p>

<p>I ask erinja for the source of her claim that the accusative of direction can only be used with locations. I also ask if this is <em>kontraŭ fundamento</em> (against [the] fundamento; again the article <em>la</em> is optional).</p>

<p>Part of her response was that I should have used the word “<em>kontrauxfundamenta</em>”, which is merely those exact words put together and used as an adjective (also creating an unnecessarily long abomination of a word… esperantists love doing that). Apparently, saying something is “against that fundamento” is incorrect. You <em>have</em> to say “against-the-fundamento”; needlessly combining all the words in to one giant adjective…. hmm. What’s her source for that? Clearly it isn’t the fundamento. Clearly, this is the version she’s most used to and therefore sees as correct; meaning all equivalent forms are incorrect. Just like in <em>The Highlander</em>, there can be only one!</p>

<p>Great. <strong>This is heart of the problem</strong>, isn’t it? You’re used to seeing something stated as X, therefore Y is incorrect even if X=Y. No consulting the only rule-book that actually exists and has any authority at all.</p>

<p>Along the way, erinja also tells me that the fundamento “shows grammar by example”; as if I have’nt read it, and as if that’s the only thing it does. <strong>That is far from the only thing it does!</strong>. As I’ve described earlier, not only does the book begin with <strong>explicit rules</strong>, the exercises provide both examples <strong>and explicit descriptions of the grammar</strong>. Anyone who’s actually worked though it knows that. I’m beginning to suspect that not many in the “community” have done those exercises.</p>

<p>But, she does at least accept that using a personal pronoun as a kind of short-hand notation for <em>the location where that person is</em> is a thing that languages do.</p>

<p>Erinja later doubles down on her insistance that <em>mi iras vin</em> is “incorrect” and chastises another poster for continuing to insist that <em>mi iras vin</em> is indeed correct. Apparently, erinja is concerned for “beginners” who will get the “wrong impression” or something. She is unconcerned, however, that with all her self-proclaimed authority and reluctance to cite any sources, she may be confusing conventions with <em>bona fide</em> rules (thus giving “beginners” misinformation). However, near the end of one of her posts, her viewpoint become clear when she says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>erinja: “If you think the established grammar has settled on the side of too much strictness in this regard… [<em>blah blah blah</em>] …in actual Esperanto as it is spoken, your interpretation is simply incorrect.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now the viewpoint is clear: “<em>Fuck Zamenhof. Fuck the Fundamento (I haven’t even read that shit). What matters is how my tiny group of internet Grammar-Nazi-Assholes are using the language! WE ARE THE AUTHORITY damn it! We’ve always dreamed of being able to throw our weight around like a big fish in a small pond, and we’ve finally a pond small enough: Esperanto!</em>”</p>

<p>Nornen pops in later to quote the PAG (an old descriptive grammar of Esperanto based on how it was being used at the time by a tiny group of nutty enthusiasts). He quotes a whole lot of it for some reason, but the only part that’s relevant is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>La akuzativo estas uzebla nur, kiam oni atingas la internon de la celo</em>  = The accusative is used only when one touches the interior of the target.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, the PAG is saying that the accusative [of direction] is only used when you enter something. This is <strong>inconsistent with</strong> Zamenhof’s rule 15 from the Fundamento.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>15: In phrases answering the question ,”where?” (meaning direction), the words take the termination of the objective [accusative] case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zamenhof speaks only of direction or location. He made no mention of having to <strong>go</strong> anywhere, much less penetrate it! Nornen admits though, that this source is not authoritative. (which makes you wonder why he bothered to quote it)</p>

<p>I suspect very few in the Esperanto “community” have worked through the Fundamento, and that the source of nearly all of their “expertise” is second-hand.</p>

<p>Next, nornen finds a passage where Zamenhof advises people to basically stay away from the accusative unless necessary and to use prepositions instead. I’m not sure if nornen realizes that <em>prictical advice</em> like this is not the same as a hard-and-fast grammatical rule. Just because Zamenhof thinks it’s advisable to do X, it doesn’t mean that Y in incorrect.</p>

<p>He also finds a quote from Zamenhof saying that, “<em>…we use the accusative to show direction (i.e. movement to some place…) if the preposition itself does not show this…</em>”. Of course, this is irrelevant, as we’re considering a situation where <strong>there is no preposition to show movement</strong>. This passage is about how we say that you go <em>into</em> something rather than <em>to</em> it. Again, irrelevant.</p>

<p>Curiously, this is one of three (<em>and only three</em>) situation where Zamenhof says we use the accusative (in the quote). And the fact that none of these includes an accusative of direction without the use of a preposition is potentially very important. After all, if the accusative of direction can only be used in conjunction with a preposition, then a sentence such as <em>Mi iras vin</em> can’t be using the accusative of direction. However, a few points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, <strong>absolutely no one</strong> on the forum had said anything about needing a preposition to form the accusative of direction, so this is an entirely new argument. Essentially, if this is the case, <strong>everyone</strong> is now wrong!</li>
  <li>Second, the Fundamento contains plenty of examples of the accusative of direction being used <strong>without a preposition</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>e.g. Exercise #28 <em>Morgaŭ mi veturos Parizon</em> (Tomorrow I will drive [to] Paris) Note the complate lack of a preposition.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Third, the Fundamento was written in 1905, while nornen’s quote is from 1892… <em>a full 13 years earlier than the Fundamento!</em> I think it’s reasonable to assume that Zamenhof further developed the language in those 13 years, and that his 1905 work is the more authoritative of the two.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nornen concludes one of his posts saying that since PAG is not authoritative, we need to ask, “Is there anything like <em>mi iras vin</em> in the Fundamento?” and, “Is there anything like <em>mi iras vin</em> in the works of Zamenhof.</p>

<p>Notice that this is the <strong>descriptive</strong> view of grammar. Something is correct if you can find a similar construction in an acceptable language sample. It’s also highly restrictive, as it logically follows that <em>nothing that isn’t found in the ‘acceptable’ works can be correct</em>.</p>

<p>But Esperanto, as a constructed language, has a <strong>prescriptive</strong> grammar. With a prescriptive grammar, we don’t look for something similar in the wild, we look at the legitimate, authoritative rules as laid down by the creator(s) (and in their most recent compilation). If something is consistent with the rules, it’s correct; if it breaks a rule, it’s not. The only exception would be if something breaks one of the implicit rules that the creator(s) didn’t actually write down. In this case, the sentence would be completely unintelligible; it wouldn’t just <em>sound wrong</em>.</p>

<h2 id="a-possible-explanation-and-fundamental-flaw">A possible explanation and fundamental flaw</h2>

<p>It’s as if there are two Esperanto’s being discussed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The language created by L.L. Zamenhof, and described in the 1905 <em>Fundamento de Esperanto</em></li>
  <li>The language used to varying degrees by a relative handful of people (the “community”)  who’ve codified their own conventions into <em>rules</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think to the average person; especially someone who <em>isn’t</em> trying to learn Esperanto and <em>doesn’t</em> speak it, Esperanto is the language created in 1905 by Zamenhof. It certainly is to me. And you can see from the thread on lernu, that definition 1 remains valid for some Esperanto learners as well.</p>

<p>But there’s a very vocal part of the Esperanto “community” who think of Esperanto as fitting definition #2. In my experience, these are mostly Assholes who get off on having (perceived) authority; authority they couldn’t have in their native language (too many speakers; too hard), or in another natural language (again, too many speakers to fool, too hard to learn a second language). In short: Grammar-Nazis.</p>

<p>An appeal to the actual authority behind the language (Zamenhof) tends to piss these people off. It threatens their ability to impress and correct others. These people get off on being perceived as having authority. It’s pretty easy to recognize them; they never cite any sources (because they think their authority should be enough… remember erenja?).</p>

<p>While I think there <em>is</em> something about Esperanto that attracts assholes, I think the problem is deeper. I think there may be a fundamental problem with all constructed languages.</p>

<h3 id="we-naturally-infer-language-rules">We naturally infer language rules</h3>

<p>If you read Krashen’s works, one of the things he talks about often is that linguists only know a fraction of the rules people use in languages. Language teachers know more rules than the average speaker, and linguists know more than language teachers, but they still don’t know all the rules.</p>

<p>And yet, people speak <em>as if they are following many many rules</em>; rules that can be described and learned, but only by studying the way language is used.</p>

<p>Many of these rules are rules that we are neither conscious of, nor consciously learn, but we use them in our native language anyway. Some non-conscious part of our brains <em>acquire</em> language rules whether or not we have explicit instruction in them. This seems to be a natural part of our brain’s language functions.</p>

<p>These <em>acquired</em> language rules guide our own language, and give us that feeling that something isn’t right when we hear rule-breaking sentences. You hear something that doesn’t sound right, and you <em>know</em> it isn’t right, even if you can’t say why.</p>

<p>When we learn a constructed language such as Esperanto, I figure these natural processes aren’t going to turn themselves off. Just like with natural languages, some part of your mind starts picking up “<em>rules</em>”. Things that break these new “<em>rules</em>” now make you feel like you “<em>know</em>” that something isn’t right.</p>

<p>These new “<em>rules</em>” will come from the <em>conventions</em> of the language “community” you engage with. Read lots of Zamenhof, and eventually the stuff he did because of his Polish background will start seeming not just <em>normal</em>, but <em>required</em>.</p>

<p>The number of “<em>rules</em>” that you perceive grows. But the problem is that many of them aren’t real rules. They weren’t created by Zamenhof. They aren’t an official part of Esperanto. They’re just meaningless conventions that you unconsciously picked up on by instinct.</p>

<p>Now someone comes along with a sentence that <em>sounds wrong</em> to you. You reach for any explanation for why this new person is wrong, and because of confirmation bias, you aren’t too picky about your source and how authoritative it is. Then you go round and round about how, “<em>oh the preposition totally changes it</em>”, or, “<em>‘on the table’ isn’t a place, you know, but onto the table is and… no wait it’s because of the direction…</em>”. You know, just pulling <em>ad hoc</em> explanations for things out of your ass. Ultimately, you end up saying that the rules laid down by Zamenhof are now irrelevant and what really matters is the “community” (excepting any times when they don’t agree with you).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This reminds me of the Facebook Group “I Judge You When You Use bad Grammar” (or something like that). I stumbled onto this group many years ago and didn’t stick around. The big image on the front page; the image that’s supposed to be an example of bad (or was it “incorrect”?) grammar was a newspaper headline that read: “Has Catherine Zeta Jones Got Only One Dress?” (It showed 2 or 3 pictures of her wearing what looked like the same dress to different events [the horror]).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hopefully, I don’t need to point out that “Has X got only one Y?” is perfectly acceptable grammar. Yet, for a great many people, this seemed to trigger a “that’s wrong” response. I’m going to speculate that while constructions such as “I’ve got a dress” are common in America, turning that into a question creates a pattern that just isn’t commonly used (“Have I got a dress?”). Worse, that sort of sentence construction (and using “got” to mean “have” in general) sounds like something a redneck would say, so it must be wrong. Most Americans would probably say “Does Cathering Zeta Jone’s Only Have One Dress?”, which means the exact same thing, but has the advantage of “feeling right”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a style “preference” or “convention”; not a grammatical issue. With your own native language it can be hard to tell what’s an error and what’s just unconventional.</p>

<h3 id="ok-but-this-is-just-a-problem-with-esperanto-right">OK, but this is just a problem with Esperanto, right?</h3>

<p>Esperanto may attract more blatant assholes than another constructed language like Klingon. I don’t know, I’m just guessing here. But the thing is I don’t see how <strong>all</strong> constructed languages don’t run into the same problem.</p>

<p>No matter what the constructed language is, once the “community” or body of works grows large enough, eventually people will naturally start to unconsciously infer rules that aren’t there. Preferences and conventions get mistaken for absolute rules, and you end up with the tyranny of the majority; no matter what the source materials say, something is <em>right</em> or <em>wrong</em> based on what the largest, or most powerful, or most influential, or vocal  group <em>says</em> about it. End of story.</p>

<p>So say good bye to your flexibility, Esperanto; it’s no longer about mere communication anymore. Now you have to be <em>correct</em>. And <em>correctness</em> is judged by the “community”…</p>

<p>The community of Grammar-Nazi-Assholes.</p>

<p>I’ve talked about why I don’t like the Esperanto <em>Community</em> here, and pretty much left the language itself alone.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in learning about the merits of the language itself (from someone who hasn’t drunk the cool-aid), then I highly recommend <a href="http://jbr.me.uk/ranto/">Ranto</a>.</p>
